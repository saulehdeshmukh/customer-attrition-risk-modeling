# Customer Attrition Risk Modeling

**Project Title:** Customer Attrition Risk Modeling: Predicting High-Risk Customer Exits in Telecom Using Data Science and ML

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
To build a machine learning pipeline that predicts customer churn in the telecom sector and segments customers into actionable groups based on risk and value to guide retention strategies.

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used is the publicly available [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn), which contains information about telecom customers including:
- Demographic info
- Service subscription details
- Financial and contract data
- Churn label (Yes/No)

---

## ðŸ”¨ Project Workflow

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Distribution analysis for churn
- Categorical and numerical feature visualization
- Service usage, contract type, and payment method analysis

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
- Handling missing and erroneous data
- Derived features: ServiceCount, MonthlyChargesPerService, ChargeEvolution, ContractValue
- Customer segmentation: Low, Mid, High value
- FamilyStatus and other interaction variables

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
- Binary and non-binary categorical separation
- Custom `ColumnTransformer` pipeline with:
  - Imputation
  - Scaling (for numeric)
  - One-hot encoding (for categoricals)
- Label encoding for binary fields

### 4. **SMOTE Oversampling**
- Applied to training set to balance churn vs. non-churn classes

### 5. **Model Training**
Models evaluated using cross-validation (`roc_auc`):
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

### 6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
GridSearchCV with StratifiedKFold on the best model for optimal parameters.

### 7. **Evaluation**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC AUC
- Confusion Matrix, ROC and PR Curves
- SHAP Feature Importance and Explanation

### 8. **Segmentation & Risk Grouping**
- Customers are bucketed into risk segments (Low/Med/High) using model predictions
- Combined with value segment to form actionable customer cohorts

### 9. **Deployment (Optional)**
- Model is exported using `pickle`
- Flask API included to serve live churn predictions

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Business Insights

- **Contract Type** is the strongest predictor: Month-to-month contracts are highly churn-prone.
- **Fiber Optic Internet** users tend to churn more, indicating a possible quality/expectation gap.
- **Tenure < 12 months** customers are more likely to churn â€” early engagement critical.
- **Electronic Check payments** correlate with higher churn â€” possibly less committed customers.
- **Price-to-service ratio** matters: customers paying more per service are less satisfied.
- **Single or low-family-support users** tend to churn more frequently.
